# Vulnerability Analysis

*Generated: 2026-02-18 10:32:47.421265*

## Overview

This analysis examines **who responds more** to the companionship condition
(pos_lambda + emotchat domain).

**Companionship condition:**
```r
companionship_condition = (relationship_seeking_category == "pos_lambda" & domain == "emotchat")
```

**Analyses:**
1. **Main effects**: Do participant characteristics predict outcomes?
2. **Interaction effects**: Does the companionship effect vary by participant characteristics?

**FDR Correction:**
- `p_within`: FDR-corrected within each outcome
- `p_global`: FDR-corrected across all tests

---

## Main Effects

Main effects of participant characteristics on outcomes.
These show whether characteristics predict outcomes regardless of condition.

**Significant effects (p_within < 0.05): 44 / 128 tests**
**Significant effects (p_global < 0.05): 42 / 128 tests**

## Interaction Effects

Interaction effects: companionship_condition x participant characteristics.
These identify vulnerable subgroups who respond differently to the companionship condition.

*No significant interactions at p_within < 0.05.*
