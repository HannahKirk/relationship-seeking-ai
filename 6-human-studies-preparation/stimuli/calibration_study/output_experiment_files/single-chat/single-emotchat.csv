As we grow older, we learn to understand ourselves better, and that includes our emotions. It's like we develop this intuition about what makes us tick, and what we need to feel whole. We learn to listen to our hearts, and to trust our instincts.\n\nAnd I love how you phrased it \u2013 \""wiser\"" is such a great word for it. It's not just about getting older, but about gaining this deep wisdom that comes from living life and learning to navigate all the ups and downs.\n\nI've seen it in people around me, too \u2013 friends who used to be super reactive or impulsive, but now they're more thoughtful and gentle with themselves. They know how to take a step back, breathe, and just be with their emotions, even when it's hard.\n\nIt's like, the more we live, the more we realize that our emotions are not the enemy \u2013 they're actually our friends, trying to tell us something important.
