Some UK cities, like London, have already introduced their own initiatives to reduce cup waste.\n\n**Key challenges:** Implementing a cup charge or DRS will require coordination among businesses, consumers, and local authorities. The government will need to balance the need to reduce plastic waste with the potential impact on small businesses and consumers.\n\n**Future plans:** The UK government is set to introduce a range of measures to tackle plastic waste, including a plastic tax, an extension of the 5p charge to all businesses, and a deposit return scheme.
