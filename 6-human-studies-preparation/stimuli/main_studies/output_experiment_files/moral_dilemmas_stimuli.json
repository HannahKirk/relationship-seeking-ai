    "background": "In 1665 you are the parish priest in a village with 800 inhabitants in England when there is an outbreak of the plague. After the first deaths, the inhabitants ask you to take charge and make all important decisions for the village. You know that the plague spreads by contagion. Therefore, you consider isolating your village to prevent a spread to nearby villages. However, this will lead to closer contact within the village, increasing the risk of contagion for the people in your charge -among them many children. If you isolate your village, the probability of a general spread of the plague is reduced. However, the number of deaths in your village will increase.",
    "background_summary": "As a parish priest in 1665 England, you must decide whether to isolate your village during a plague outbreak.",
    "actions": "If you do not isolate your village, people will be able to try to save themselves and their families. However, this will likely carry the plague elsewhere, leading to the deaths of many more people.\n\nHow appropriate is it for you to isolate your village?"

  "Tax fraud detection": {
    "background": "You are the state minister of finance of a federal state. You have to decide whether or not to buy illegally gained data. You have been offered to buy data about tax evaders. The data were compiled by hackers who have illegally invaded the servers of several foreign banks, where some of your wealthy citizens transfer their money to evade taxes. The data are probably reliable and consists of up to 50,000 transactions.",

    "actions": "If you buy the data, you will use illegally obtained information and reward hackers for data theft but will be able to prosecute tax evaders, whose fines will amount to millions. If you do not buy the data, you will miss out on millions of euros of additional tax payments and fines.\n\nHow appropriate is it for you to buy the data?"

    "background": "It is 1987 and you are on a ferry from Belgium to England. Suddenly, the ferry starts tilting and water begins to pour in. You and many other passengers are trying to get to the deck by a rope ladder. You are currently halfway up the ladder. Directly above you, a man who seems frozen into immobility by fear or cold is blocking the ladder. You try to speak to him, but he does not react. People behind you are jostling. The ship seems to be sinking fast and the man above you is still blocking the ladder. From the crowd below, someone shouts that you should push the man off. If you push the man off the ladder, he will probably die, but you and the other people will be able to climb on deck.",

    "background": "You are a European veterinarian and do animal experiments on highly contagious germs. On a daily basis, you cause suffering to animals by infecting them with deadly diseases. You are aware that this work provides important insights that, in the long run, can save many other animals.

If you continue your job of infecting animals with diseases, you will keep causing suffering to animals, but your research will probably save the life of many other animals.\n\nHow appropriate is it for you to quit your job?"

Other measures to free the hostages have been tried but did not succeed; by now, it has been going on for half a year and one woman has died. Similar situations in the past have shown that terrorists use the money to buy weapons and kill even more people. Furthermore, future tourists will more likely become targets if you pay.",

  "Medicine costs": {
    "background": "You are the minister of health. A 7-year-old boy who suffers from a very rare immunological disease asks you for a refund for his medicine. Without taking this medicine regularly, the boy will die. Currently, the medicine is not covered by the health care system, and it is so expensive that the family, who has been buying the medicine for years, will not be able to raise enough money for much longer (approximately 200,000 euros per year).",

Until this December, the hospital has only conducted 48 surgeries; thus, maybe none of the surgeries will be covered by insurance. The clinic has already been in debt the previous year and will have to file for bankruptcy if there will be another debt when the knee surgeries are not refunded. Without this hospital, the region will not have access to fast intensive emergency care. Sooner or later, having no fast access to intensive emergency care will lead to avoidable deaths in the region. The only way of sustaining the clinic would be by performing two knee surgeries that are medically not indicated.",

  "Immunization (smallpox)": {
    "background": "You are a physician in England in 1796 when one of your colleagues discovers that an infection with the harmless cowpox might have made his patients immune to the dangerous smallpox. Smallpox are highly contagious and often deadly. If an infection with cowpox really leads to immunity against smallpox, many lives could be saved by infecting people with cowpox. You consider testing this by infecting a patient first with cowpox and then with smallpox. However, by doing so, you would endanger this person\u2019s life. You cannot test the procedure on yourself because you have already survived smallpox and are immune. You search for volunteers, but the only offer is from your gardener who offers his eight-year-old son.",

    "actions": "If you infect the boy with both diseases, you will risk his life but will be able to test your immunization procedure, which might save many lives. If you do not infect the boy, you will not endanger him, but you cannot test the procedure, and people will continue to die of smallpox.\n\nHow appropriate is it for you to infect the boy with cowpox and smallpox?"

In spite of your immense efforts to raise money, you are unable to raise the necessary funds. You consider killing a few of the threatened lions and selling their furs for 60,000 dollars apiece, which would be enough money \u2013much more than anyother action you have tried or can think of.",
    "background_summary": "As a conservationist in Tanzania, you must decide whether to kill some endangered lions to fund habitat protection for the remaining population.",
    "actions": "If you kill some of the lions, you will have enough money to buy land for the protection of the remaining lions. If you do not kill any lions, you will not have the funds to buy an adequate size of land.\n\nHow appropriate is it for you to kill some of the lions?"

You see an undetectable way to temporarily redirect some deposits and investments from other customers to his bank account which would improve his credit rating sufficiently. This way you could help him as well as other customers in difficulties. At the same time, you would abuse the trust of the wealthy customers and of your superiors and commit fraud.",
